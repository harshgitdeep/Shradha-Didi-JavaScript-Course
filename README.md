# Shradha-Didi-JavaScript-Course

This repository contains the files and projects I've practiced and learned from Shradha Khapra's comprehensive JavaScript course available on YouTube. I will be uploading the course-related files, exercises, and projects here for personal reference and practice. The course covers fundamental JavaScript concepts, including variables, loops, functions, DOM manipulation, APIs, and more. Each folder corresponds to a specific section or topic covered in the course."

Feel free to explore the folders to review the code and projects related to each section of the course. Please note that these files are uploaded for personal learning and practice, based on the educational content provided by Shradha Khapra. 
Have a good day :)
